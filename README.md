# Medli
### Welcome to Medli, an attractive free and open source operating system made in C#

Due to the current lack of LFN writing one can only use filenames with the texteditor
that have 5 digits in the title and 3 letter extensions. 

The text editor can currently view any file with 3 letter extensions formatted as a text file.

Use the command 'help' to view a list of commands and use 'help <command>' for more help on specific commands.


### Currently Medli has the following:
* Error Handling

* FAT File System

* Simple Terminal/Shell

* Text Editor and Viewer, now with the advanced MIV text editor!

* A little Linux easteregg by the name of cowsay ;)
			- only one cowfile though atm

* Documentation!

### Work In Progress:
