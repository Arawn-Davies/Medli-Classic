# Chocolate NG

##Welcome to Chocolate NG, a new alternative to the original Chocolate OS.
##Chocolate and Chocolate NG cannot currently be used simulatenously and are developed at different rates.

###Update on versioning!
Because I'm ridiculous with versioning, I thought of a new versioning system, so we can get rid of the mess that was the old one.
Half of it is a typical Major.Minor numbering scheme but the last build number goes upto 25, so one can use the alpha/beta/charlie names.
A very limited graphical representation of this is the following:

Major.Minor.Build

∞.∞. Up to 25

###FAQ
ChocolateNG has a slightly different shell to Chocolate and doesn't have Cocoashell.
It does however include the text editor and text viewer.

Due to the current lack of LFN writing one can only use filenames with the texteditor
that have 255 digits in the title and 3 letter extensions. 

The text editor can currently view .TXT and .CNG files, them being Chocolate NG Files.

Use the command 'help' to view a list of commands and use 'help <command>' for more help on specific commands.


###Currently Chocolate NG has the following:
Error Handling

FAT File System

Simple Terminal/Shell

Text Editor and Viewer

~~Basic Shell Scripting~~


###I am working on:
