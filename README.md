# Medli

## Welcome to Medli, an attractive free and open successor to the original Chocolate OS.
Medli has come a long way since the early days of Cosmos, with it's roots going back to the old Milestone days with
Visual C# Express 2008 being the IDE. Medli originally started off as Aza-DOS back in late 2010, a very basic non-DOS 
'DOS' without any filesystem functionality - we tended to place DOS at the end of things which weren't even capable of using disks. 
Over the years, Aza-DOS has evolved and changed to be what it is now, Medli OS. Here's to many more years and progress with Medli. 


### FAQ
- Due to the current lack of LFN writing one can only use filenames with the texteditor
that have 255 digits in the title and 3 letter extensions. 

- The text editor can currently view any file with 3 letter extensions formatted as a text file.

- Use the command 'help' to view a list of commands and use 'help <command>' for more help on specific commands.


### Currently Medli has the following:
- Error Handling

- FAT File System

- Simple Terminal/Shell

- Text Editor and Viewer, now with the advanced MIV text editor!

- A little Linux easteregg by the name of cowsay ;)
			- only one cowfile though atm



### Work In Progress:
- manpages documentation

- Tidying stuff up...

- 'cd ..' command is currently useless, so that needs implementing properly

- ngscript/midnascript needs fixing/implementing/whatever, ain't been updated for quite a long time
