<h2 id="welcome-to-medli-an-attractive-free-and-open-successor-to-the-original-chocolate-os">Welcome to Medli, an attractive free and open successor to the original Chocolate OS.</h2>
<p>Medli has come a long way since the early days of Cosmos, with it’s roots going back to the old Milestone days with
Visual C# Express 2008 being the IDE. Medli originally started off as Aza-DOS back in late 2010, a very basic non-DOS 
‘DOS’ without any filesystem functionality - we tended to place DOS at the end of things which weren’t even capable of using disks. 
Over the years, Aza-DOS has evolved and changed to be what it is now, Medli OS. Developed by Arawn Davies, with some assistance 
and guidance from people over time, Medli wouldn’t be what it is now without them, so thank you so much to everyone who’s helped in 
any way at all. Here’s to many more years and progress with Medli.</p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
<p>Due to the current lack of LFN writing one can only use filenames with the texteditor
that have 255 digits in the title and 3 letter extensions.</p>

<p>The text editor can currently view any file with 3 letter extensions formatted as a text file.</p>

<p>Use the command ‘help’ to view a list of commands and use ‘help <command />’ for more help on specific commands.</p>
